# Amagaki website

This is the marketing website and documentation manual for Amagaki. It's part of
the same repository as the Amagaki project itself, so that documentation can be
written alongside new features.

Additionally, the development version of Amagaki can be used with the Amagaki website
to test new features on a real website, as they are being developed.

## Setup

```
# From the root of this repository, start the Amagaki TypeScript watcher:
npm run dev

# In another tab, from the `website` subdirectory, start the development server:
cd ./website/
npm run dev
```
