# Introduction

Amagaki is a static site generator. It's written in TypeScript and designed
specifically for offering a great developer experience for hand-coding marketing
and informational websites.

## Feature highlights

- **TypeScript.** Amagaki is written in TypeScript. Its code is meant to be
  well-organized, easy to understand, and extendible with plugins.
- **Multiple template engines.** Amagaki ships with Nunjucks for HTML
  compatibility, but supports unlimited template engines.
- **Not a large project.** Amagaki has a slim core. It contains everything
  needed to assemble a marketing website, but not more than that. It should be
  easy to understand Amagaki's core code and extend it as needed with plugins.
- **Localization.** Easy localization is a first-party citizen. Configure locales
  and Amagaki will take care of the workflows around localization to make it
  easy to translate and localize your project.
