# Using partials to assemble pages

In earlier portions of the documentation you learned about ways to manage
content, relationships between content, the rendering context, and templates.

you to architect reusable modules and insert different content into those
modules depending on their use case. All “modular pages” should be created by

*   Reusable partial templates
*   Reusable partial styles
