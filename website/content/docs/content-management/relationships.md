# Relationships

The anatomy of an Amagaki project can best be categorized into the following parts:

- Collections, which have documents
- Views (or templates), for generating HTML
- Static files (i.e. images, media, JS and CSS files served to users)
- Source files (i.e. TypeScript and Sass files, for generating static files)
- Partials, which map content to reusable template modules
- The global base template

Additionally, two dimensions can further impact rendering of the above elements:

- Locales
- Build environments
